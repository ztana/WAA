in today's lab. I find JSF do a lot for us, I don't need me to do session and servlet link.
I had a little problem of not remember some staff in WAP, but I recall some of them by doing today's homework.
And I got a some question I didn't found before:
I have processRequest in my doPost. when I tried to forward to a jsp, it did not work in doPost, but worked in processRequest.

I upload my lab to github, which is easy to read and can download if you want.
which can be found in this link: [Link Text](https://github.com/ztana/WAA).
